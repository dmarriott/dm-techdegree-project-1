Overview

For your first project, youâ€™ll practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. You'll modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is a great way for you to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives you a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise your experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.

You'll also practice using GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with potential employers.
